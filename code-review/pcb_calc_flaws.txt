./kicad/pcb_calculator/transline/coax.cpp:226:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination.
  Consider using strncat or strlcat (warning, strncat is easily misused). 
./kicad/pcb_calculator/transline/coax.cpp:243:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination.
  Consider using strncat or strlcat (warning, strncat is easily misused). 
./kicad/pcb_calculator/transline/rectwaveguide.cpp:378:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination.
  Consider using strncat or strlcat (warning, strncat is easily misused). 
./kicad/pcb_calculator/transline/rectwaveguide.cpp:404:  [4] (buffer) strcat:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination.

./kicad/pcb_calculator/transline/coax.cpp:205:  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be overflowed. Perform bounds checking,
  use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger than
  the maximum possible length. 
./kicad/pcb_calculator/transline/coax.cpp:217:  [2] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination.
  Consider using strncpy or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily misused). Risk
  is low because the source is a constant string.

  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination.
  Consider using strncpy or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily misused). Risk
  is low because the source is a constant string.
./kicad/pcb_calculator/transline/coax.cpp:225:  [2] (buffer) sprintf:
  Does not check for buffer overflows. Use snprintf or vsnprintf. Risk
  is low because the source has a constant maximum length.
./kicad/pcb_calculator/transline/coax.cpp:236:  [2] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination.
  Consider using strncpy or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily misused). Risk

  Does not check for buffer overflows when concatenating to destination.
  Consider using strncat or strlcat (warning, strncat is easily misused).
  Risk is low because the source is a constant string.
./kicad/pcb_calculator/transline/rectwaveguide.cpp:392:  [2] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination.
  Consider using strncpy or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily misused). Risk
